Automatically leave MS Teams call when participant count falls below a customizable threshold. Follow through installation and setup and run `autodisconnect watch`. This will connect to Teams, wait for you to join a meeting (you can start it while in a meeting already though) and disconnect when participant count falls below some threshold.

# Installation
1. Install *Node.js* from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or from your package repository of choice.
2. Open command line and run `$ npm install -g autodisconnect`. This will download and install latest version of `autodisconnect`

# Setup
This project uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to connect to Microsoft Teams app, which is based on Electron. This approach relies on a condition that Teams are launched with a specific debugging flag set, enabling it is quite straightforward though:
* ##### On Windows:
    You need to launch `Teams.exe` executable with `--remote-debugging-port=56874` flag. The port is arbitrary, but `56874` is the default. The way I have it set up is I have a shortcut on the desktop with the above flag added to `Target`.
    You can usually find `Teams.exe` binary in `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\Teams.exe`
* ##### On Linux / MacOS / FreeBSD / Whatever:
    You should follow the same procedure as above for Windows, I don't have a mac and I don't want to boot into Linux, if someone wants to, they can fill this out. All this boils down to running `Teams` with `--remote-debugging-port=56874` and should work on any platform that is capable of doing so.
