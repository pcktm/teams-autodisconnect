# Installation
1. Install *Node.js* from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or from your package repository of choice.
2. Open command line and run `$ npm install -g autodisconnect`. This will download and install latest version of `autodisconnect`

# Setup
This project uses [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) to connect to Microsoft Teams app, which is based on Electron. This approach relies on a condition that Teams are launched with a specific debugging flag set, enabling it is quite straightforward though:
* ##### On Windows:
    You need to launch `Teams.exe` executable with `--remote-debugging-port=56874` flag. The port is arbitrary, but `56874` is the default. The way I have it set up is I have a shortcut on the desktop with the above flag added to `Target`.
    You can usually find `Teams.exe` binary in `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\Teams.exe`
* ##### On Linux / MacOS / FreeBSD / Whatever:
    You should follow the same procedure as above for Windows, I don't have a mac and I don't want to boot into Linux, if someone wants to, they can fill this out. All this boils down to running `Teams` with `--remote-debugging-port=56874` and should work on any platform that is capable of doing so.

**Important notice**: This program will attempt to start Teams in debug mode automatically if they are not running, or will attempt to restart them in debug mode, automatically choosing the nearest available port, starting from the passed in port argument. Then, the app will wait for you to join a meeting, constantly polling every 5 seconds for status.
